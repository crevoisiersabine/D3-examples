D3-examples
===========
I created two types of simple visualisation tools using D3 (index.html):

1. a line/bar chart that shows the total number of canadian citizenship applications, as well as the number of successful application over 5 years.

2. a geographical representation on my last holiday trip with circles sized compared to the length of time I spent in each place during the roadtrip.

The two tools can be accessed through a single page that uses jQuery to respond to user selection choices.

This piece of work was done to experiment with D3 & jQuery as I learned the concepts through following both Scott Murray's Interactive Data Visualisation book and the O'Reilly Javascript and jQuery, the missing manual.
